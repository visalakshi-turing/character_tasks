    "This is a pickle indeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step is to understand how to construct or expand the string. This can be achieved by reading the string from the beginning and adding more elements as we progress. Each element encodes elements further down the string. And since we have the beginning of the string, we can initially expand the string into itself and then continue further. For instance, if we take '12211' and try to expand it, we will get the following:\n",
    "    - 1 corresponds to `1` at the beginning of the string\n",
    "    - We have: `1` and passed through `1`\n",
    "    - 2 corresponds to `22`\n",
    "    - We have: `122` and passed through `12`\n",
    "    - 2 corresponds to `11`\n",
    "    - We have: `12211` and passed through `122`\n",
    "    - In the next step we are to add a single element as we have `1` coming up after `122`. We need to decide whether it will be a `1` or a `2`. If we add `1`, it would be added to the end of the string we have - `12211`+`1`, but since we can only have a maximum sequence of 2 elements, we can't do this and we must add `2`.\n",
    "    - 1 corresponds to `2` as we have `1` as the last element.\n",
    "    - We have: `122112` and passed through `1221`\n",
    "    - 1 corresponds to `1` as it can't be `2` as it would mean a sequence of 2 '2'\n",
    "    - We have: `1221121` and passed through `12211`\n",
    "- Next, we start consuming the elements that were expanded by us, in this case, the next element is 2 - number on the right.\n",
    "    - 2 corresponds to `22` as the most recent element is '1'.\n",
    "    - We have: `122112122` and passed through `122112`\n",
    "- This way, we got to a sequence of `122112122` which matches how the sequence proceeds in your example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid keeping the entire string in memory (which could be quite large), we only need to keep the element we are currently reading and expanding and all the elements after it to the rightmost element after which we will add this new expansion. We can use python's implementation of a queue - `deque` from the collections module. This will allow us to consume the left part of the sequence and add elements on the right. We could use a `list`, but then python would copy the list over and over each time we remove the leftmost element.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to figure out the minimum length from which we can start the queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we take just '1' and try to expand it:\n",
    "     - 1 corresponds to `1`\n",
    "     - We have: `1`\n",
    "- But we can't continue it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's try '122'(we are not trying '12' as it can't be fully expanded as we do not have a full sequence for '2'):\n",
    "     - 1 corresponds to `1`\n",
    "     - We have: `1`\n",
    "     - 2 corresponds to `22`\n",
    "     - We have: `122`\n",
    "     - 2 corresponds to `11`\n",
    "     - We have: `12211`\n",
    "     - 1 corresponds to `2`\n",
    "     - We have: `122112`\n",
    "     - etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea we will implement is to continuously expand the string, starting from '122' string, until we meet the desired length. During this, we will count the '1's we will encounter and that's it.\n",
